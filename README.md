# Ludum Dare 32 | Berry, the Last Straw

> Berry is a strawberry, the last one actually :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, in the middle of a zombie grape apocalypse. He knows he's goin' down, but not without a fight!

_Theme: **Unconventional Weapon**_

![Berry Title](art/berrytitle.png)

To fight the horde of zombie grapes his only weapons are his own seeds, but he has to spin really fast to throw'em on to cause enough damage. The downside of this is that he doesn't have control on the direction of his projectiles!

But there's more! The seeds are parts of his own body so, whenever he throws one he starts to lose juice!

Luckily, he can regrow the seeds he threw and recover his own health, BUT he can't do both at the same time! Berry can only recover his health with his pack full of seeds!

Run, shoot, wait, recover, shoot again, run even more then DIE! :cat:

Too bad for you, Berry...

## Controls

Click, hold and drags your mouse on the game screen to move Berry. Press spacebar to spin and throw seeds!

On the Android version, you do both with the touch. So it's like "sudden death" mode for mobile users. :cat:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dependencies

To build the project, you need the latest OpenFl and Lime tools installed. Also, you need the Actuate library.

This project was made using OpenFl 3.0.2, but I recommend you to build it using legacy mode (with the `-Dv2` and `-Dlegacy` flags), for performance (mainly on the Windows version).
